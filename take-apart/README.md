Acer Chromebook 13 Take Apart
=============================

### Open up

To open the Acer Chromebook 13 you need a Phillips #1 screwdriver.

First, flip over the Chromebook and unscrew the marked screws.  
**Note:** There is *no* screw underneath the label unlike what you might expect.

There are clips attaching the bottom panel to the Chromebook.  
Use your fingernails to pry apart the bottom panel from the rest of the Chromebook.  
The best place to start is the side USB port. Insert your fingernail between the metal USB port and the bottom panel and pull.  
After the first clip has opened, slide your finger around the Chromebook to detach the bottom panel.

After the bottom panel is detached, carefully lift it up.  
**ATTENTION!** The headphone jack PCB is screwed to the bottom panel and connected to the motherboard by a flex cable that is glued to both parts. Make sure to not break it.  
Put the bottom panel to the side and admire the cheapness of the Chromebook's inside:

Quite boring on the other hand is the bottom panel's inside:

### Battery removal

To remove the battery, peal of the sticky tape between it and the motherboard.  
Then uncrew the marked screws attaching the battery to the Chromebook (one on the left, one on the right).  
Finally slide the battery towards the motherboard and lift it up:
